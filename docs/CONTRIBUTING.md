# Contributing

- Fork -> feature/<short-desc> -> PR to main
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Ensure all linting and type checks pass
- Add tests for feature changes (unit & integration)
- Use `client/src/mock-data/mockdata.ts` for local UI testing if needed
- Document API changes in docs/API_REFERENCE.md

PR checklist:
